		<p>
			Climate change is a a prominent issue in the current day and age. Global warming can cause irreversible damage to the Earth and can cause the extinction of human kind.
			Global warming is a natural phenomenon that occurs due to greenhouse gases that are released in to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases include Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane(CH4) and water vapor(H2O).
			These gases get released with everyday natural processes, such as breathing and animal decomposition cycles.
			When solar rays hit the surface of the Earth, certain rays bounce back from the surface of the Earth and get sent to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trap these re-emitted rays and send them back onto the surface of the Earth. This is called the Greenhouse Effect.</p>
		<p>
			Global warming is not all bad, it is what prevents us from having winters that last the whole year.
			The problem arises when humans get involved.
			Ever since the industrial revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels to support industrial activities. The burning of these fossil fuels has been generating large amounts of greenhouse gases that get released into the atmosphere.
			This amplifies the Greenhouse Effect, which further causes a rise in temperature.
